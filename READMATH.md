### Mixture Density Networks in PyTorch

Last update: March 2019

---

Lightweight implementation of a mixture density network [1] in PyTorch.

An MDN models the conditional distribution over a scalar response as a mixture of Gaussians.
$$
p_\theta(y|x) = \sum_{k=1}^K \pi^{(k)} \mathcal{N}(\mu^{(k)}, {\sigma^2}^{(k)}),
$$
where the mixture distribution parameters $\{\pi^{(k)}, \mu^{(k)}, {\sigma^2}^{(k)}\}_{k=1}^K$ are output by a neural network with parameters $\theta$, trained to maximize overall log-likelihood.

In order to predict the response as a multivariate Gaussian distribution (for example, in [2]), we assume a fully factored distribution (i.e. a diagonal covariance matrix) and predict each dimesion separately. Another possible approach would be to use an auto-regressive method like in [3], but we leave that implementation for future work.

#### Usage

```python
import torch
from mdn.model import MixtureDensityNetwork
from mdn.utils import mixture_density_loss, sample_gaussian_mixture

x = torch.randn(5, 1)
y = torch.randn(5, 1)

# 1D input, 1D output, 3 mixture components
model = MixtureDensityNetwork(1, 1, 3)
pred_parameters = model(x)

# use this to backprop
loss = mixture_density_loss(y, pred_parameters)

# use this to sample a trained model
samples = sample_gaussian_mixture(pred_parameters)
```

For further details see the `examples/` folder.
